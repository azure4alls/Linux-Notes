## Partitioning Disks

Partitioning a disk involves dividing a physical storage device into separate, manageable sections called partitions. Each partition functions as an independent disk within the operating system, allowing for better organization, multi-boot setups, or separation of system files from user data. The two main partition table formats used to define how these partitions are structured on the disk are the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the GUID Partition Table (GPT).

Imagine your disk as a bookshelf divided into compartments:

```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|   Compartment 1  |   Compartment 2  |   Compartment 3  |   Free Space     |
|   (/dev/sda1)    |   (/dev/sda2)    |   (/dev/sda3)    |                  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|    50 GB         |    100 GB        |     8 GB         |     42 GB        |
|    ext4          |    ext4          |     swap         |                  |
|    Mounted at /  |    Mounted at    |                  |                  |
|                  |      /home       |                  |                  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
```

In this illustration, the disk `/dev/sda` is divided into three partitions with varying sizes and purposes, and there's remaining free space available for future use.

### Basic Partition Operations

Several operations can be performed on disk partitions:

- If unallocated space exists on the disk, new partitions can be created to store data, install additional operating systems, or organize files.
- Removing a partition frees up space on the disk but also erases all data within that partition. It's essential to back up any important information before deletion.
- Adjusting the size of existing partitions can help optimize disk space usage. This may involve expanding a partition into adjacent free space or shrinking it to make room for new partitions.
- After creating a partition, it must be formatted with a filesystem (e.g., ext4, NTFS) to store files. Formatting prepares the partition for data storage.

### Relationship Between Physical Disks and Partitions

A physical disk is the actual hardware component that stores data. Partitions are logical divisions within this disk, allowing the operating system to manage different areas separately. Each partition can be treated as an independent disk with its own filesystem and mount point.

Visual representation:

```
+-------------------+
|   Physical Disk   |
|     (/dev/sda)    |
|                   |
|  +-------------+  |
|  | Partition 1 |  |
|  | (/dev/sda1) |  |
|  +-------------+  |
|  | Partition 2 |  |
|  | (/dev/sda2) |  |
|  +-------------+  |
|  | Partition 3 |  |
|  | (/dev/sda3) |  |
|  +-------------+  |
+-------------------+
```

Each partition is a segment of the physical disk that can be managed independently, formatted with different filesystems, and mounted at different points in the directory tree.

### Disk Naming Conventions

In Linux, disks and partitions are named using specific conventions to identify the device type, order, and partition number.

**Device Type Indicators**:

- `/dev/sdX` represents SCSI or SATA disks. The 'X' is a letter starting from 'a' for the first disk, 'b' for the second, and so on.
- `/dev/hdX` refers to older IDE disks.
- `/dev/vdX` denotes virtual disks in KVM environments.
- `/dev/xvdX` indicates virtual disks in Xen virtualization.

**Partition Numbers**:

Partitions are numbered starting from 1. For example, `/dev/sda1` is the first partition on the first disk.

Examples:

- `/dev/sda`: First disk.
- `/dev/sdb`: Second disk.
- `/dev/sda1`: First partition on the first disk.
- `/dev/sdb2`: Second partition on the second disk.

### Types of Partitions

#### Primary Partitions

Primary partitions are the main partitions on a disk. On an MBR-partitioned disk, you can have up to four primary partitions. These partitions are used to boot operating systems or store data.

**Creating a Primary Partition**:

- Use a partitioning tool like `fdisk` or `parted`.
- Allocate a portion of the disk's storage to the partition.
- Format the partition with a filesystem (e.g., `ext4`).

Example using `fdisk` to create a primary partition:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

Inside `fdisk`:

```
Command (m for help): n
Partition type:
   p   primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free)
   e   extended
Select (default p): p
Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1
First sector (2048-1048575999, default 2048): [Press Enter]
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P}: +50G
Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 50 GiB.
```

**Formatting the Partition**:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
```

#### Extended and Logical Partitions

Extended partitions are a workaround for the MBR limitation of four primary partitions. An extended partition acts as a container for logical partitions, allowing you to create more than four partitions on a disk.

**Creating an Extended Partition**:

Inside `fdisk`:

```
Command (m for help): n
Partition type:
   p   primary (3 primary, 1 extended, 0 free)
   e   extended
Select (default p): e
Partition number (1-4, default 4): 4
First sector (some value): [Press Enter]
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P}: [Press Enter to use remaining space]
Created a new extended partition 4.
```

**Creating Logical Partitions Within the Extended Partition**:

```
Command (m for help): n
All primary partitions are in use
Adding logical partition 5
First sector (some value): [Press Enter]
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P}: +20G
Created a new logical partition 5 of type 'Linux' and of size 20 GiB.
```

Repeat the process for additional logical partitions.

#### Comparison

Here's a comprehensive comparison of different partition types:

| **Feature**          | **Primary Partition**                                                             | **Extended Partition**                                                          | **Logical Partition**                                                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | A main partition that can host an operating system or data directly.              | A special type of partition that acts as a container for logical partitions.    | A partition within an extended partition used to store data.                       |
| **Maximum Number**   | Up to 4 primary partitions per disk under MBR.                                    | Only 1 extended partition per disk under MBR (counts as one of the 4 primary).  | Numerous logical partitions can exist within the extended partition (limited by OS). |
| **Purpose**          | Used to install operating systems or store data directly.                         | Provides a way to bypass the limit of 4 primary partitions by containing logical partitions. | Allows the creation of additional partitions beyond the primary limit for organizing data. |
| **Bootability**      | Can be marked as active to boot an operating system (on MBR systems).             | Cannot be used to boot directly; it's a container.                              | Generally not bootable, but can be configured with bootloaders in some cases.       |
| **Storage Location** | Entries stored directly in the partition table within the MBR or GPT.             | Defined in the partition table but contains an extended boot record (EBR) for logical partitions. | Defined within EBRs linked in a chain inside the extended partition.               |
| **Limitations**      | Limited to 4 per disk under MBR (no limit under GPT).                             | Only one extended partition allowed per disk under MBR.                         | Number limited by available space and operating system constraints.                 |
| **Use Cases**        | Ideal for systems requiring multiple operating systems or separate data areas.    | Necessary when more than 4 partitions are needed on an MBR disk.                | Useful for organizing data into separate partitions beyond the primary partition limit. |
| **Deletion Impact**  | Deleting removes the partition and all its data.                                  | Deleting removes the extended partition and all contained logical partitions.   | Deleting removes only the specific logical partition and its data.                  |

### Partition Table Formats: MBR vs. GPT

Partition table formats are  organize data on storage devices, enabling the system to locate, identify, and manage different partitions on a disk. Two of the most widely used partition table formats are the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the GUID Partition Table (GPT). Each format comes with its own structure, limitations, and features, which affect how storage devices can be utilized and managed. While MBR is an older format, widely compatible across various operating systems, GPT is a newer standard designed to address the limitations of MBR, offering greater flexibility and scalability for modern storage needs.

#### Master Boot Record (MBR)

The Master Boot Record is the original partition table format, introduced in the 1980s, which has been the standard for decades. Located in the first sector of a storage device, the MBR holds the boot loader and information about the disk's partitions. However, MBR has some notable limitations: it supports a maximum disk size of 2 TB and can only create up to four primary partitions. For users needing more partitions, an extended partition must be created to hold additional logical partitions. Despite these limitations, MBR's simplicity and broad compatibility with older systems make it a popular choice for users and devices that do not require large storage capacities or numerous partitions.

#### GUID Partition Table (GPT)

The GUID Partition Table was developed as a modern replacement for MBR, overcoming many of its restrictions. GPT is part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard and supports much larger disks, theoretically up to 9.4 zettabytes, with practically unlimited partition counts. Each partition in GPT is identified by a globally unique identifier (GUID), enhancing flexibility and reducing the likelihood of partition-related conflicts. Additionally, GPT maintains multiple copies of its partition table for improved data redundancy and recovery, making it more reliable than MBR. GPT has become the preferred choice for newer systems, particularly those requiring large storage capacities or more than four partitions, and is increasingly supported by most modern operating systems.

Comparison Table:

| Feature                    | MBR                            | GPT                                |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Max Disk Size              | 2 TB                           | 9.4 ZB                             |
| Max Partitions             | 4 primary partitions           | 128 partitions (default)           |
| Data Redundancy            | No                             | Yes (multiple partition tables)    |
| Error Checking             | None                           | CRC32 checksums                    |
| Boot Mode                  | BIOS                           | UEFI                               |
| Compatibility              | Older systems                  | Modern systems                     |

### Viewing Partition Tables

To inspect the partition table of a disk, use tools like `fdisk`, `parted`, or `gdisk`.

#### Using `fdisk`

```bash
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
```

Example output:

```
Disk /dev/sda: 500 GiB, 536870912000 bytes, 1048576000 sectors
Disk model: ST500DM002-1BD14
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x12345678

Device     Boot   Start        End    Sectors   Size Id Type
/dev/sda1          2048  104857599 104855552    50G 83 Linux
/dev/sda2     104857600 209715199 104857600    50G 83 Linux
```

- The disk `/dev/sda` is 500 GiB in size.
- It uses the `dos` partition table format (MBR).
- There are two primary partitions: `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sda2`.

### Managing Disk Partitions

#### Checking Free Space

To see how much unallocated space is available on the disk:

```bash
sudo parted /dev/sda print free
```

Example output:

```
Model: ATA ST500DM002-1BD14 (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 500GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End     Size    Type      File system  Flags
         0.00B  1049kB  1049kB            Free Space
 1       1049kB  50.0GB  50.0GB  primary   ext4
 2       50.0GB 100GB   50.0GB  primary   ext4
         100GB  500GB   400GB             Free Space
```

There is 400 GB of free space starting at 100 GB.

#### Creating a New Partition

To create a new primary partition using `fdisk`:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

Inside `fdisk`:

```
Command (m for help): n
Partition type:
   p   primary (2 primary, 0 extended, 2 free)
   e   extended
Select (default p): p
Partition number (3,4, default 3): 3
First sector (some value): [Press Enter]
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P}: +100G
Created a new partition 3 of type 'Linux' and of size 100 GiB.
```

After creating the partition, format it:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
```

#### Resizing Partitions

Resizing partitions involves careful steps to avoid data loss.

**Shrinking a Partition**:

- Before making any changes, it’s essential to create a **backup** of important data to prevent potential data loss.
- To shrink the filesystem, utilize **tools** specific to the filesystem type; for example, `resize2fs` is suitable for **ext4** filesystems.

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1 40G
```

Following the filesystem shrink, use **partition** management tools such as `fdisk` or `parted` to modify the partition size.

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

Inside `fdisk`, you will need to **delete** the existing partition and recreate it, specifying the new, smaller size and ensuring it starts at the **same sector** as the original.

**Expanding a Partition**:

- To increase the partition size, adjust the **partition** to encompass additional available space using `fdisk` or `parted`.
- After resizing the partition, use filesystem tools like **resize2fs** to expand the filesystem to fill the entire resized partition.

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
```

**General Tips for Partition Resizing**:

- Always **verify** that the new partition size is accurate before applying changes, as incorrect sizing can lead to **data loss** or corruption.
- It's advisable to **unmount** the partition (if possible) prior to resizing operations to avoid potential **errors**.
- After resizing, use the **fsck** (filesystem check) tool to check the filesystem's **integrity**, ensuring it operates correctly.

```bash
sudo fsck /dev/sda1
```

**Post-Resize Checks**:

- Run a **health check** on the disk and partition after resizing to confirm everything is functioning as expected.
- If the partition is used by the **operating system**, it may be necessary to **reboot** for changes to take effect fully.

#### Deleting Partitions

To delete a partition:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

Inside `fdisk`:

```
Command (m for help): d
Partition number (1-4): 3
Partition 3 has been deleted.
```

Write the changes:

```
Command (m for help): w
```

#### Converting MBR to GPT

Converting a disk from MBR to GPT requires care. It's recommended to back up all data before proceeding.

**Using `gdisk`**:

Install `gdisk` if necessary:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gdisk
```

Run `gdisk`:

```bash
sudo gdisk /dev/sda
```

Inside `gdisk`:

```
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.5

Partition table scan:
  MBR: MBR only
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: not present

***************************************************************
Found invalid GPT and valid MBR; converting MBR to GPT format
in memory.
***************************************************************

Command (? for help): w
```

Write the GPT partition table:

```
Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING PARTITIONS!!

Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
```

### Practical Examples and Commands

#### Listing All Disks and Partitions

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,MAJ:MIN,RM,SIZE,RO,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT
```

Example output:

```
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0    50G  0 part /
├─sda2   8:2    0    50G  0 part /home
└─sda3   8:3    0   100G  0 part /data
```

#### Formatting and Mounting a New Partition

After creating `/dev/sda3`:

**Formatting**:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
```

**Creating a Mount Point**:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/data
```

**Mounting the Partition**:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/data
```

**Verifying the Mount**:

```bash
df -h | grep sda3
```

Example output:

```
/dev/sda3       99G   60M   94G   1% /mnt/data
```

#### Adding the Partition to `/etc/fstab`

To mount the partition automatically at boot, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`.

**Get the UUID**:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sda3
```

Example output:

```
/dev/sda3: UUID="abcd-1234" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="12345678-03"
```

**Edit `/etc/fstab`**:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add the following line:

```
UUID=abcd-1234   /mnt/data   ext4   defaults   0   2
```

### Changing MBR to GPT Using gdisk

Converting a disk's partition table from the Master Boot Record (MBR) format to the GUID Partition Table (GPT) can unlock new capabilities, such as supporting disks larger than 2 terabytes and allowing more than four primary partitions. The `gdisk` utility is a powerful tool that facilitates this conversion while aiming to preserve your existing data. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through the process of changing an MBR partition table to GPT using `gdisk`, providing detailed explanations and interpretations at each step.

#### Preparing for the Conversion

Converting from MBR to GPT is a significant operation that can potentially lead to data loss if not done carefully. Proper preparation is crucial.

- Before making any changes, back up all important data on the disk. While `gdisk` is designed to convert partition tables without losing data, unexpected issues can occur.
- Ensure that your system's firmware (BIOS/UEFI) supports GPT. Most modern systems with UEFI firmware can boot from GPT disks. Older BIOS systems may require additional steps, like creating a BIOS boot partition.

#### Using gdisk to Convert MBR to GPT

With preparations complete, you can proceed to convert the disk using `gdisk`.

#### Step 1: Examine the Current Partition Table

Start by inspecting the existing partition table to understand the current disk layout.

```bash
sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda
```

**Example Output:**

```
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.5

Partition table scan:
  MBR: MBR only
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: not present

Found valid MBR with protective or hybrid GPT; converting MBR to GPT format in memory.
This operation may not preserve existing partitions.

Disk /dev/sda: 20971520 sectors, 10.0 GiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier (GUID): FFFFEEEE-DDDD-CCCC-BBBB-AAAA99998888
Partition table holds up to 128 entries
First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 20971486
Total free space is 0 sectors (0 bytes)

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048        20971519   10.0 GiB    0700  Microsoft basic data
```

- The disk `/dev/sda` currently uses the MBR partitioning scheme.
- There's one primary partition occupying the entire disk.
- `gdisk` is ready to convert the MBR partition table to GPT in memory.

##### Step 2: Launch gdisk Interactive Mode

Run `gdisk` to interactively convert the partition table.

```bash
sudo gdisk /dev/sda
```

**Example Output:**

```
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.5

Type 'help' or '?' to view a list of commands.

Command (? for help):
```

- You've entered `gdisk`'s interactive prompt.
- You can now issue commands to modify the partition table.

##### Step 3: Review the Existing Partition Table

Before making changes, it's wise to review the current partitions.

At the `gdisk` prompt, type:

```
p
```

**Example Output:**

```
Disk /dev/sda: 20971520 sectors, 10.0 GiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier (GUID): A1B2C3D4-E5F6-7890-1234-56789ABCDEF0
Partition table holds up to 128 entries

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048        20971519   10.0 GiB    0700  Microsoft basic data
```

- Confirms the presence of a single partition spanning the entire disk.
- The partition code `0700` indicates a Microsoft basic data partition.

##### Step 4: Write the New GPT Partition Table

To apply the GPT format, write the changes to the disk.

At the `gdisk` prompt, type:

```
w
```

**Example Output:**

```
Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING PARTITIONS!!

Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
```

- `gdisk` warns that writing the GPT data will overwrite the existing MBR partition table.
- Typing `y` confirms that you want to proceed.

After confirmation, you should see:

```
OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/sda.
The operation has completed successfully.
```

- The new GPT partition table has been successfully written to the disk.
- You can now exit `gdisk`.

##### Step 5: Verify the Conversion

Confirm that the disk now uses the GPT partitioning scheme.

```bash
sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda
```

**Example Output:**

```
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.5

Disk /dev/sda: 20971520 sectors, 10.0 GiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier (GUID): B123C456-D789-0E12-3456-7890ABCDEF12
Partition table holds up to 128 entries

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048        20971519   10.0 GiB    8300  Linux filesystem
```

- The disk now has a GPT partition table.
- The existing partition is preserved and recognized as a GPT partition.
- The partition code `8300` indicates a Linux filesystem.

##### Step 6: Adjust Partition Types (If Necessary)

Depending on your system, you may need to adjust the partition type codes.

At the `gdisk` prompt, type:

```
t
```

You'll be prompted to enter the partition number:

```
Partition number (1-1): 1
```

Then enter the new hex code:

```
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): 8300
```

- Ensures that the partition type is set correctly for your operating system.
- You can list available codes by typing `L` at the prompt.

##### Step 7: Create a BIOS Boot Partition (For BIOS Systems)

If your system uses BIOS (not UEFI), you'll need a BIOS boot partition to boot from a GPT disk.

At the `gdisk` prompt, create a new partition:

```
n
```

**Example Input:**

- **Partition Number**: Press Enter to accept the default.
- **First Sector**: Press Enter to accept the default.
- **Last Sector**: `+1M` (creates a 1 MB partition).
- **Hex Code**: `ef02` (BIOS boot partition).

**Example Output:**

```
Command (? for help): n
Partition number (2-128, default 2): [Press Enter]
First sector (34-2047, default = 34) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: [Press Enter]
Last sector (2048-2047, default = 2047) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: +1M
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): ef02
Changed type of partition to 'BIOS boot partition'
```

- A small BIOS boot partition is created at the beginning of the disk.
- This partition is required for GRUB to boot from a GPT disk on BIOS systems.

##### Step 8: Write Changes and Exit gdisk

Save the changes to the disk.

At the `gdisk` prompt, type:

```
w
```

Confirm when prompted:

```
Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
```

**Example Output:**

```
OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/sda.
The operation has completed successfully.
```

##### Step 9: Reinstall the Bootloader

Since the partition table has changed, you need to reinstall the bootloader.

For GRUB on BIOS systems:

```bash
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
```

**Example Output:**

```
Installing for i386-pc platform.
Installation finished. No error reported.
```

- GRUB is reinstalled to work with the new GPT partition table.
- No errors indicate a successful installation.

##### Step 10: Update the Filesystem Table (fstab)

Ensure that the `/etc/fstab` file references the correct partitions.

Use `blkid` to find the new UUIDs:

```bash
sudo blkid
```

Update `/etc/fstab` accordingly.

##### Step 11: Reboot and Test

Reboot the system to verify that everything works correctly.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

- If the system boots without issues, the conversion was successful.
- If problems occur, you may need to troubleshoot bootloader configurations.

#### Visual Representation of the Conversion

To better understand the process, here's a simplified visual:

Before Conversion (MBR):

```
+-----------------------+
|       MBR Disk        |
|-----------------------|
| MBR Partition Table   |
|                       |
| +-------------------+ |
| |   /dev/sda1       | |
| |   Primary         | |
| |   Linux           | |
| +-------------------+ |
|                       |
+-----------------------+
```

After Conversion (GPT):

```
+-----------------------+
|       GPT Disk        |
|-----------------------|
| GPT Partition Table   |
|                       |
| +-------------------+ |
| |   /dev/sda1       | |
| |   Linux Filesystem| |
| +-------------------+ |
| +-------------------+ |
| |   /dev/sda2       | |
| |   BIOS Boot Part. | |
| +-------------------+ |
|                       |
+-----------------------+
```

- The disk now uses GPT, with the original partition preserved.
- A new BIOS boot partition is added for bootloader compatibility.

### Safety Precautions

- Always back up important data before making changes.
- Unmount partitions before resizing or deleting.
- For system partitions, use a live CD/USB to make changes.
- Verify commands and parameters to avoid mistakes.
- Ensure you're familiar with the tools and steps involved.

### Common Errors and Troubleshooting

#### Error: "Partition in Use"

- The **cause** of this error is usually that the partition is mounted or actively in use by the system. 
- To resolve this, unmount the partition by running:

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sda1
```

It’s also advisable to **close** any applications or services currently using the partition, as they can prevent the partition from unmounting properly.

#### Error: "No Free Sectors Available"

This error generally occurs when there is **no unallocated space** left on the disk. To address this, you can either shrink existing partitions to **create free space** or, if needed, upgrade to a larger disk or use additional storage to accommodate the expansion.

#### Error: "Filesystem Check Required"

- Filesystem inconsistencies after resizing can prompt this error.
- To fix it, run a **filesystem check and repair** with the following command:

```bash
sudo fsck -f /dev/sda1
```

This command performs a comprehensive **scan and repair** of the filesystem, helping to restore it to a consistent state after any partition resizing activities.
